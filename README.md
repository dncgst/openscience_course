Open Science. Guiding principles and best practices
===================================================

## SYLLABUS

### Course description

Open science is the movement to make scientific research, data and dissemination accessible to all levels of an inquiring society [@FOSTER]. Open Science is about increased transparency, re-use, participation, cooperation, accountability and reproducibility for research. Open science is science done properly. This course is tailored for undergraduate students and early-career researchers in archaeological science. It intends to teach guiding principles (open methods, open source, open data, open access, open peer review, open educational resources) and best practices (reproducible research) for doing science properly. Beside theoretical modules, this course provides hands-on sections to various methods that can be used to make your research reproducible and fulfil the current EU policy requirement for open science.

Offered in presence and/or online

Course prerequisite: None

Teaching language: English

### Learning objectives

Learn the basic principles of open science (open methods, open source, open data, open access, open peer review, open educational resources) and understand the ethical, legal, social, economic, and research impact arguments for and against Open Science. Understand EU and publishing policies. Learn some of the best practices of open science (computational science research, literate programming, pre-print/data repositories, open access journals, open licenses) and be able to use a variety of resources to create a workflow for reproducible research (R, GitHub, Markdown).

### Assessments

#### Quizzes

There are 12 quizzes (week 1 to 12), to be submitted by email. You must earn a grade of at least 80% to pass a quiz. You may attempt each quiz up to 3 times. Your score will count toward your final grade.

#### swirl modules

[swirl](https://swirlstats.com/) is an interactive learning environment for the R programming language. The are ... swirl modules (week .. to 12), to be submitted by email. The swirl modules are optional and will not count toward your final grade, but it is highly recommended to complete them.

#### Final exercise

The final exercise focus on replicating a case study and it will be assessed by peer assessment. You will be asked to replicate a case study and you will be evaluated by your classmates on your work.

#### Final exam

The final exam consists of quizzes.

### Technical Information

Regardless of your platform (Windows, Mac or Linux) you will need a high-speed Internet connection in order to watch the videos, download data and software, submit your assignments. You will also need to have admin permits on your PC to be able to install software. This course make exclusively use of free and open software.
